Still learning...

<ul>
    <li>To sing</li>
    <li>To be nice to each other</li>
    <li>To let go of the things that this is not</li>
</ul>

We are a social singing group that is more or less secular, the focus being learning how to sight sing and being around good folks.

The Learner's Group and Sacred Harp more generally sing sacred Christian music, but consider asking about religion or politics a bit of a faux pas.

We have loaner books!
