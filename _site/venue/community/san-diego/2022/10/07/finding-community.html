<p>San Diego has had a group “SD Fa So La” that would meet for Sacred Harp singing weekly, rotating venues to serve the whole county better. SD Fa So La might still be a thing, but at the moment it seems to be defunct. The contact information that I’ve found has disconnected phone numbers and emails and websites. If you know these folks, feel free to point them towards myself or Sean Francis Conway!</p>

<p>A few of us have been meeting privately now for a few months, but that space was on lend to us and we might not have as much access as we’d like. It’s also not a public space that we could advertise.</p>

<p>We’re looking for a venue! We have some requirements for the space, namely that we can sit in the hollow square and sing loudly without bothering anyone. Ideally the acoustics would be like a church, but we’ve been singing in a tiki bar now for some time, so we’re a little flexible there.</p>

<p>I’m hoping this site helps us find each other!</p>

<p>Sean Francis has loaner books!</p>

<p>I hope to get to sing with you!</p>
