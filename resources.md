Shapenotes are kickin rad!

<br/>

The hymnal that we use is the 1991 version of [Sacred Harp](http://originalsacredharp.com/).

There are others that are also in the shape not tradition that might be worth checking out:

* [Christian Harmony](http://www.thechristianharmony.com/)
* [Shenandoah Harmony](https://shenandoahharmony.com/buy/)

<br/>

Sacred Harp Bremen has a midi player for all the songs in the book! They also have all the sheet music on the site. Always nice to be able to pull them up on your phone!

I also find that the [rudiments](https://sacredharpbremen.org/en/rudiments-3/) is an excellent music theory chapter that I use outside of the context of singing fairly often.
